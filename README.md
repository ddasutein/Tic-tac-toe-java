# Tic-tac-toe Java game

This is one of my very first programming projects I've done. It is no longer updated, but it does contain some code and logic to understand how the game works. I also don't garantee that it may successfully compile in your IDE. Feel free to take a look at the code.

Download the .JAR file if you want to see it in action. Do note that you must have Java installed on your computer for it to work.
